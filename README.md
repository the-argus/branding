# About Me

I like to make games and software. I care a lot about tools and processes, so
I've learned (and tried to make games in) a lot of different programming
languages. Currently I'm writing games with C++20 and raylib.

I tried makefiles, CMake, meson, scons, and autotools, but Zig buildsystem was
the best by far, and yes I will talk to about it without being asked.

I really really like when software is simple and does what its supposed to do.

OS kernel, and programming language."
