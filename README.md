**About Me**

I am a third year game design and development student at RIT. I can write C++,
C#, C, and Python. Nim and Rust are neat, too. Haven't written enough of them, though.
Current favorite language is Zig.

I am passionate about simple, sane software development tools. I make my variable
names really long descriptions of exactly what the variable is. I hope everything
is open source one day.
