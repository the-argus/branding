**About Me**

I am a second year game design and development student at RIT. I know Python, C#, C, C++,
HTML/CSS/JS and, more recently, [nim](https://nim-lang.org/).
I love open source tools because I like to customize everything. I currently use
NixOS linux on all my computers (but Debian on my servers... ðŸ˜”).
