**About Me**

I am a third year game design and development student at RIT. I can write C++,
C#, C, Python, Nim, and Rust. Current favorite language is Zig.

- I am passionate about simple, sane software development tools.
- I am passionate about software that does what it is supposed to, and does it as efficiently as possible.
- I make my variable names really long descriptions of exactly what the variable is.
- I hope everything is open source one day.
