**About Me**

I am a second year game design and development student at RIT. I know Python, C#, C, C++,
HTML/CSS/JS, Nim, Rust, and last but not least: Zig my beloved ðŸ’•

I love open source tools because I like to customize everything. I currently use
NixOS linux on all my computers (but Debian on my servers... ðŸ˜”).
