# **[My Portfolio](https://the-argus.github.io/portfolio)**

**About Me (as a programmer):**
I am a second year game design student at RIT. I know Python, C#, C, C++,
HTML/CSS/JS and, more recently, [nim](https://nim-lang.org/). I am familiar with
GNU/Linux and many of the pieces of software that make up most popular systems
such as Debian (and derivatives), RHEL, Arch, and Gentoo. I currently use NixOS
(the best distro of them all).
