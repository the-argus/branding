# About Me

I like to make games and software. I care a lot about tools and processes, so
I've learned (and tried to make games in) a lot of different programming
languages. Currently I'm writing games with C++20 and raylib.

"To make a game from scratch, you must first invent your own SoC architecture,
OS kernel, and programming language."
